# 🇯🇴 Jordan Dev Collective

Welcome to the **Jordan Dev Collective** — a knowledge-sharing and collaboration hub for software developers in Jordan.

This repo is:
- A 📚 living knowledge base (via the Wiki)
- A 💡 project directory (in `/projects`)
- A ❓ question board and collaboration space (via Issues)

This is not where code lives — it’s where **learning**, **organizing**, and **collaborating** begins.
