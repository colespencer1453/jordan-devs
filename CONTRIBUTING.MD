## ✅ Contribution Rules

### 💬 Discussions
- Great for questions, ideas, advice, introductions, and prompts.
- Use clear titles (e.g. "What's the best JS course in Arabic?" or "Let's build a Ramadan countdown app").

### 🐞 Issues
Use Issues for:
- Bug reports in shared code or broken resources
- Feature requests for community tools or repo organization
- Project tasks (e.g., "translate this README")
- Requests for help on a specific community need

Avoid using Issues for:
- General questions → Use Discussions
- New projects or contributions → Use PRs

### 📂 Projects Folder
Each shared project should:
- Live in its own folder in `/projects`
- Include a `README.md` with:
  - What it is
  - How to contribute
  - Who started it (optional)
  - Current status

### 🔁 Pull Requests
- Be specific about what you're changing or adding
- Keep your PR focused on one thing (e.g., not adding a tutorial *and* fixing three bugs)
- Write helpful titles and descriptions
- You're welcome to submit a draft and ask for feedback!

---

## 🏷️ Labels
We'll use GitHub labels to organize Issues and PRs. Some examples:
- `good first issue`
- `help wanted`
- `beginner`
- `needs discussion`
- `meta`

## 🧠 Tips for First-Time Contributors

- Start small! Fix a typo, clarify a sentence, or add a question to Discussions.
- Ask for feedback if you're unsure.
- You don't need to be an expert to contribute — just show up with curiosity.
